I am a [FCAI](https://fcai.fi/) postdoctoral researcher, working in the field of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), in the Media Labs Group (led by Prof. Perttu Hämäläinen) and [User Interfaces Group](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/) (led by Prof. Antti Oulasvirta) at Aalto University.

I completed my PhD Degree in July 2019 from University of Birmingham, UK. My primary PhD advisor was Prof. Andrew Howes. The title of my dissertation is "Approximate optimal control model for visual search tasks".

My current research interests include reinforcement learning, decision making, supervisory control and intelligent interactive systems.

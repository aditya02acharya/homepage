I am a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham. My current area of research is multi-agent reinforcement learning and human-machine teaming, and I collaborate with the Alan Turing Institute (ATI) and Army Research Labs (ARL).

Previously, I was a [FCAI](https://fcai.fi/) postdoctoral researcher, working in the field of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), in the Media Labs Group (led by Prof. Perttu Hämäläinen) and [User Interfaces Group](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/) (led by Prof. Antti Oulasvirta) at Aalto University.

My current research interests include reinforcement learning, decision making, behaviour modelling and intelligent interactive systems.
